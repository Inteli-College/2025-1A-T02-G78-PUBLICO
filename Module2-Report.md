# Public Report â€“ Conversational AI assistant for entrepreneurs  
*(M2 Consolidation April â€“ JuneÂ 2025)*  

## 1. Executive summary  
Independent professionals and microâ€‘business owners routinely lose opportunities because their communication channels (WhatsApp, eâ€‘mail, calendar, etc.) are scattered and noisy. Our team is building an AIâ€‘powered assistant that connects to existing channels, classifies and summarizes messages, and automates firstâ€‘contact replies, giving entrepreneurs more focus and time to solve other priorities and not losing oportunities.

## 2. Problem & opportunity  
- **Information overload andâ€¯small teams**: solo founders juggle dozens of leads daily and miss timely followâ€‘ups.  
- **Fragmented channels**: eâ€‘mail, WhatsApp, and calendars are siloed, making context retrieval slow.  
- **High switching cost**: full CRMs/ERPs are expensive and overâ€‘engineered for earlyâ€‘stage businesses.  
- **Market gap:** an intuitive assistant, with low barriers of interaction, that listens, organizes, and responds without the complexity of a CRM.

## 3. Solution overview  
| Layer | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Connectors** | Gmail (live), WhatsApp (beta), Googleâ€¯Calendar (planned) | âœ…/ðŸŸ¡ |
| **ETL & Storage** | Structured DB + **Qdrant** vector DB for semantic search | âœ… |
| **Intelligence** | LLM (Gemini API) + custom NLP classifier for lead categories | âœ… |
| **Interface** | WhatsApp chatbot + web dashboard (MVP frontâ€‘end) | ðŸŸ¡ |
| **Automation** | Daily summaries, smart reply suggestions, cronâ€‘driven digests | ðŸŸ¡ |

## 4. Technology & architecture (colocar mais aqui)

Key choices  
- **Microâ€‘services** per connector (Dockerâ€‘compose for local dev).  
- **Qdrant** for fast similarity search across messages.  
- **Redis** queues decouple ingestion from processing.

## 7. Risks & mitigations (sugestÃ£o do gpt, ver se faz sentido)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Thirdâ€‘party API policy changes | Maintain abstraction layer, diversify channels. |
| LLM cost spikes | Cache embeddings, fineâ€‘tune smaller models where viable. |
| Data privacy (PII) | Endâ€‘toâ€‘end encryption at rest & transit, GDPRâ€‘aligned policies. |
