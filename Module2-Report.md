# Public Report â€“ Conversational AI assistant for entrepreneurs  
*(M2 Consolidation April â€“ JuneÂ 2025)*  

## 1. Executive summary  
Independent professionals and microâ€‘business owners routinely lose opportunities because their communication channels (WhatsApp, eâ€‘mail, calendar, etc.) are scattered and noisy. Our team is building an AIâ€‘powered assistant that connects to existing channels, classifies and summarizes messages, and automates firstâ€‘contact replies, giving entrepreneurs more focus and time to solve other priorities and not losing oportunities.

## 2. Problem & opportunity  
- **Information overload andâ€¯small teams**: solo founders juggle dozens of leads daily and miss timely followâ€‘ups.  
- **Fragmented channels**: eâ€‘mail, WhatsApp, and calendars are siloed, making context retrieval slow.  
- **High switching cost**: full CRMs/ERPs are expensive and overâ€‘engineered for earlyâ€‘stage businesses.  
- **Market gap:** an intuitive assistant, with low barriers of interaction, that listens, organizes, and responds without the complexity of a CRM.

## 4. Technology & architecture

#### 1. Email service
- Scheduled job that monitors IMAP every 2 minutes
- Basic classification via NLP model with semantic search
- Dual storage: PostgreSQL (structured data) + Qdrant (semantic search)
- Incremental tracking via UIDs to avoid reprocessing

#### 2. WhatsApp integration
- Evolution API as middleware for WhatsApp Business
- Real-time webhook + Redis Streams for asynchronous processing
- Flow: WhatsApp â†’ Evolution API â†’ Webhook â†’ Redis Streams â†’ Qdrant
- Consumer groups for distributed processing and fault tolerance

#### 3. Vector search system (Qdrant)
- Vector database for semantic similarity search
- SentenceTransformers 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for embeddings (384 dimensions)
- Unifies search between emails and messages WhatsApp
- Consumer groups for parallel processing

### Backend and APIs
- **Python 3.11+** with **FastAPI** for REST APIs
- **SQLAlchemy** for ORM with PostgreSQL
- **SentenceTransformers** for generating NLP embeddings

### Node.js
- **Evolution API** (TypeScript) for WhatsApp Business integration

### Data infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Structured data
- **Redis 6.2**: Cache and message broker (Streams)
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search

### Orchestration
- **Docker Compose** with network host mode
- `run.sh` script for coordinated service startup

## Data streams
### Email processing
```
IMAP â†’ Basic Classification â†’ PostgreSQL + Qdrant (embeddings)
```

### WhatsApp processing
```
Evolution API â†’ Webhook â†’ Redis Streams â†’ Qdrant (embeddings)
```

### Semantic search
```
Query â†’ Vectorization â†’ Qdrant â†’ Results by Similarity
```

## Implemented patterns

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Redis Streams for asynchronous processing
- **Database Per Service**: PostgreSQL (email), Redis (WhatsApp), Qdrant (search)
- **Consumer Groups**: Distributed processing with exactly-once delivery
- **API-First**: FastAPI with automatic Swagger documentation

## 6. Next steps  

1. **POC testing** â€“ finish WhatsApp and Gmail connections + LLM, onboard early adopters.  
2. **Dashboard v1** â€“ KPI widgets (lead funnel, response SLA).  
3. **Implementing other connectors** â€“ expand TAM and multiâ€‘channel view.  
4. **Paid tier** â€“ subscription billing, advanced automations, calendar management.  
5. Plus: other features priorization coming from POC results.
