# Relatório Público – Progresso do Módulo 1

## Public report – module 1 summary

### Objective
This report presents the outcomes of the last module of our project development, focused on ideation, research, and MVP (Minimum Viable Product) definition. The aim was to deeply understand the problems faced by our potential users and design feasible solutions to be prototyped in the upcoming module.

---

### Research overview
Throughout this module, we conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative research to validate pain points and identify opportunities for innovation. The key focus areas were:

1. Virtual assistants and productivity tools  
2. Payments and bureaucracy challenges for foreigners in Brazil  
3. Social discovery platforms for local events and activities  

---

### From ideas to MVPs
After careful evaluation of technical feasibility, market fit, and regulatory complexity, we refined and narrowed down our scope to focus on two main MVPs:

#### 1. Management assistant (in progress)
A virtual assistant integrated with messaging platforms (e.g., WhatsApp and Email) designed to:
- Summarize important messages  
- Suggest and automate replies  
- Offer reminders and weekly productivity insights  

**Target users:** Entrepreneurs and freelancers managing multiple communication channels.  
**Insights from research:**
- High interest in more intelligent, context-aware assistants  
- Current tools (e.g., Siri, Alexa) still fall short in productivity scenarios  
- Manual task tracking is still very common despite available tools  

#### 2. Events and activities discovery platform (in progress)
An app that helps users discover local events and hobbies through an interactive map and integrated ticketing.

**Target users:** Young adults and hobby-seekers eager to try new experiences.  
**Key features:**
- Find nearby events via map  
- See where friends are going  
- Social features and event reviews  

**Insights from research:**
- 70% of users interviewed showed interest in using such a platform  
- Strong demand for a solution that helps people overcome the fear of starting activities alone  
- Verification and trust are essential for adoption

### Stablecoin-based Pix payment platform (postponed)
Initially one of our top ideas, this solution aimed to allow foreigners to make Pix payments in Brazil using stablecoins without needing a Brazilian bank account.

**Key insight:**  
Many foreigners expressed frustration with Brazil’s bureaucracy, especially regarding Pix access.

**Research data:**
- 11 qualitative responses indicated pain points around CPF requirements and lack of Pix access.  
- Participants showed strong interest in a solution that bridges crypto and local payments.  

**Reason for pause:**  
Despite the innovation potential and validated user need, significant regulatory risks and KYC barriers in Brazil make short-term implementation risky. The idea may be revisited in future stages.

### Productive idea validation
As part of our research and prioritization, we collected internal team perceptions on the most "productive" or promising idea.  
This internal ideation survey gathered 18 unique responses, highlighting where team energy and interest aligned for future development.

---

### Additional research highlights

#### Pix and foreigners research
- Revealed systemic issues with Pix access for foreigners.  
- Indicated high demand for user-friendly, accessible financial services.  
- Showed interest in platforms offering crypto-to-BRL conversion without bureaucracy.  

#### Event discovery app feedback
- Public reception was very positive.  
- Users expressed that such an app would help find new experiences, discover hobbies, and meet new people.  
- Trusted event curation and friend integration were noted as essential for adoption.  

---

### Next steps (module 2 – sprint 1)
- Develop a Value Proposition Canvas for each prioritized solution.  
- Start requirements elicitation and define technical scope.  
- Plan a prototype roadmap to be completed by the end of the module.  
- Set clear validation goals and metrics for each MVP.  

---

### Final thoughts
This first module provided a strong foundation for the development of two promising MVPs. We validated real user pain points through research, aligned internally on priorities, and made difficult but necessary decisions regarding feasibility and scope.

We're excited to move forward with prototyping and real-world testing in the next phase.
